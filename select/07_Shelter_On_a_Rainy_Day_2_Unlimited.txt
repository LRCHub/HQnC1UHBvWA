Oh
Shelter on a rainy day
You may need me like I need you

I see the clouds gathing in the sky
When my worries, fill my mind
What to call us, begins to fade
I want to be with you when it's starts to rain
'Cause I can hide in your arms
So safe and one
With you as my protection
To help me through the storm

You give me shelter on a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away
You've washed my tears away, Yeah!
Yeah yeah

If inside your heart, it starts to rain
Just call me up, I ease the pain
You don't even need to be alone
When the wind, begins to mour
'Cause whenever you may need me, like I need you
Then let me be right by your side
If love will see it through

You give me shelter on a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away

You give me shelter on a rainy day
On a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
(Uuuh you give me shelter)
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away

A shelter on a rainy day
A lucky warm place, for you and I to stay
Hum, what you're thinking
No tell me no lies because your eyes are blinking
There's a place girl, down deep in my heart
You know the feeling, a relationship to star
I send my love without delay
'Cause you know I got a shelter on a rain day

You give me shelter hey yeh
Your love has washed them all away

You give me shelter on a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away

You give me shelter on a rainy day
(On a rainy day)
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
(Uuuhh you give me shelter)
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away
