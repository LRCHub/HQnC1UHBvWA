A long time ago when the earth was green,
There were more kinds of animals then you've ever seen.
They would run around free while the world was being born,
But the loveliest of all was the unicorn.

There was green alligators and long-necked geese,
Humpty backed camels and chimpanzees.
Cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
The loveliest of all was the unicorn.

But the the lord saw some sinnin' and it caused Him pain.
And He said, "Stand back, I'm going to make it rain!"
He said, "Hey, Brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do,
Go build me a floating zoo,"
And take some of em'
Green alligators and long-necked geese,
Humpty backed camels and chimpanzees.
Cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
Dont you forget my unicorn.

Now Noah was there and he answered the calling
And he finished the arc just as the rain started falling.
They marched in the anmals two by two and he sang out as they went thew.
"Hey lord!"
"I got your green aligators and long-necked geese,
Humpty backed cammels and chimpanzees, cats and rats and elephants and as long as our born I just cant see no unicorn!"
But Noah looked out to the driving rain, but the unicorns was hiding playing silly games.they were kinking and splashing as the rain started pouring. oh them foolish unicorns.
Then the arc started moving and it drifted with the tide, and the unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried.
And the water came up, and sort of floated them away. And that's why you've never seen a unicorn to this very day.

But youll see green aligators and long-necked geese, humpty backed cammels and chimpanzees, cats and rats and elephants but as sure as your born the loveliest of all was the unicorn.

End!
