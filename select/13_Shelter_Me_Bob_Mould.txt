Shelter me from everything you do
Shelter me I cant see the truth
Keep me from this pain I see
Keep me from the pain you deal
Keep me from reality
Keep me in suspended disbelief

I can't see the truth from you
I can't see reality
I can't see the truth from you reality
Shelter me from everything you do
Shelter me suspended disbelief

Shelter me shelter me from yoou
Shelter me sheltered from the truth
Shelter me keep me from the truth
Shelter me suspended disbelief

A little less affection every day
As it resonates, reverberates, and trails away
The slow romantic decay
As is resonates, reverberates, and trails away
