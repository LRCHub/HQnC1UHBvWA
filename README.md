# Porter Robinson & Madeon – Shelter

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I could never find the right
way to tell you
Have you noticed I've been gone?
Cause I left behind the home
that you made me
But I will carry it along
Mm, it's a long way forward
So trust in me
I'll give them shelter
like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone
You'll be watching over us
Until you're gone
When I'm older
I'll be silent beside you
I know words won't be enough
And they won't need to know
our names or our faces
But they will carry on for us
Mm, it's a long way forward
So trust in me
I'll give them shelter
like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone
You'll be watching over us
Until you're gone
Mm, it's a long way forward
Trust in me
I'll give them shelter
like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone
You'll be watching over us
Until
